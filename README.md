# AkaiaLabs 🪐 ContinuityOS

**Decentralized autonomous Community Operating System for Algorithmic Societies.**

## 🚧 Disclaimer 🚧

The project is in active development and it's just the beginning. Expect lots of placeholders and drastic architectural / API changes.

## Overview

ContinuityOS mainly consists of two parts — Core and Subsystems.

### Core

Implements foundational functionalities and data storages and configures crucial infrastructure services, tying the whole system together.

[Singularity](./core/spacetimedb/modules/singularity/README.md)

[Sovernet](./core/sovernet/README.md)

### Subsystems

Subsystems are complex software solutions each focused on a specific part of the use case spectrum.

[Corvi.d](./subsystems/corvi.d/README.md) - communication

[Raiven](./subsystems/raiven/README.md) - artificial intelligence

[Keep](./subsystems/keep/README.md) - knowledge base

[Watch](./subsystems/watch/README.md) - intel gathering and environmental awareness

[Consensus](./subsystems/consensus/README.md) - decentralized governance

## TODO

- [ ] MicroVM encapsulation for each individual subsystem
- [ ] A modular OS distribution tailored for hosting subsystems on dedicated hardware nodes
