# Crow.d subsystem

Experimental container-like environment for [crow.d](https://github.com/akaia-labs/crow.d) using [Redox](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox) on [RVVM](https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM).

The purpose of the project is to create a homogeneous Rust-based runtime by running [Redox](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox) inside [RVVM](https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM) â€“ packaging [SpacetimeDB](https://github.com/ClockworkLabs/SpacetimeDB) (with [crow.d](https://github.com/akaia-labs/crow.d) server modules deployed within it) â€“ and related ecosystem services into a unified container-style subsystem.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

First, you need to clone the given repo and enter the dedicated directory:

```

### Preparing Redox image

If you already have a `redox_minimal-net_riscv64gc_*_harddrive.img` image:

```bash
cp {path-to-the-image}/redox_minimal-net_riscv64gc_*_harddrive.img {path-to-this-repo}/redox/redox_minimal-net.img
```

Otherwise, just:
