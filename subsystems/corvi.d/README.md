# AkaiaLabs Corvi.d subsystem

Experimental container-like environment for [Corvi.d](https://github.com/akaia-labs/corvi.d) using [Redox](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox) on [RVVM](https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM).

The purpose of the project is to create a homogeneous Rust-based runtime by running [Redox](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox) inside [RVVM](https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM) â€“ packaging [SpacetimeDB](https://github.com/ClockworkLabs/SpacetimeDB) (with [Corvi.d](https://github.com/akaia-labs/corvi.d) server modules deployed within it) â€“ and related ecosystem services into a unified container-style subsystem, ready to be deployed on a real dedicated hardware, if needed.

git clone https://github.com/akaia-labs/corvi.d
cd corvi.d/subsystems/corvi.d
```

### Preparing Redox image

If you already have a `redox_minimal-net_riscv64gc_*_harddrive.img` image:

```bash
