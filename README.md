# 🪐 AkaiaLabs Continuity OS

Decentralized autonomous community operating system.

🚧 WORK IN PROGRESS 🚧

## Overview

Continuity mainly consists of two parts — Core and Subsystems.

### Core

Implements foundational functionalities and data storages and configures crucial infrastructure services, tying the whole system together.

#### Singularity

The most important part of the system, a [SpacetimeDB](https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB.git) module

that acts as an identity provider and communication buffer, handles authentication / authorization, ...

#### Roadmap

- [ ] ⏳ A resilient community-owned network infrastructure solution ready for off-grid applications.

  1. [ ] ⏳ [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/manual/whatis.html) as intranet topology basis
  2. [ ] [Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/) as Internet bridge

- [ ] Consensus subsystem — a custom minimalistic low-footprint blockchain for DAO-driven decentralized governance

### Subsystems

Subsystems are complex software solutions each focused on a specific part of the use case spectrum.

## Endgame roadmap

- [ ] MicroVM encapsulation for each individual subsystem
- [ ] A modular OS distribution tailored for hosting subsystems on dedicated hardware nodes
